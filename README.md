# OAB File Parser

This Python script parses an Offline Address Book (OAB) version 4 details file, extracting and decoding the contained properties and saving the parsed data to a JSON file. The script follows the specifications detailed in the [MS-OXOAB] documentation.


## Usage

The script reads a binary OAB file (udetails.oab) and extracts properties based on the predefined PidTagSchema. The parsed data is written to a parsed_udetails.json file.
